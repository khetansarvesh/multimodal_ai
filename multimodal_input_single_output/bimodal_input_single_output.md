# Bimodal Input Single Output

Now here bimodal inputs can be of many types : 



# $\color{cyan}{Text\ +\ 2D\ Input\}$

These are systems that can take both text and images as inputs
- Such models are commonly know as Large MultiModal Models (LMMs) 




# $\color{cyan}{Text\ +\ Video\ Input\}$




# $\color{cyan}{Text\ +\ 3D\ Input\}$
