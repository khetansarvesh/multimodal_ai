# Bimodal Input Single Output

Now here bimodal inputs can be of many types : 



# $\color{cyan}{Text\ +\ 2D\ Input\}$

These are systems that can take both text and images as inputs
- Such models are commonly know as Large MultiModal Models (LMMs) 




# $\color{cyan}{Text\ +\ Video\ Input\}$
1. Representation Learning :
   - [VideoBERT](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.01766) (Google, April 2019)
   - ActBERT
2. Downstream Tasks :
   - Built In Video Search eg suppose in a movie of 2hr you want to search for a car exploding scene
   - Video Captioning
   - Video Retrieval i.e. given a txt prompt retrieve all the relevant videos (youtube algorithm)



# $\color{cyan}{Text\ +\ 3D\ Input\}$
1. Representation Learning :
2. Downstream Tasks :



# $\color{cyan}{Text\ +\ Audio\ Input\}$
